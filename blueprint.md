# Aura - The Autonomous AI Engineering Assistant

**Aura** is an autonomous AI engineering assistant that continuously reviews code, generates tests, detects issues, predicts regressions, and triggers automated actions — all with near-zero human intervention.

## Project Outline

### Design & Style

*   **Layout:** A responsive, single-page layout with a clear and intuitive structure.
*   **Hero Section:** A prominent, eye-catching hero section with a bold headline, a compelling subheading, and a clear call-to-action.
*   **Features Section:** A dedicated section to highlight the key features of the application, presented in a clean, easy-to-scan format.
*   **Stats Section:** An interactive section with animated numbers to highlight key metrics and achievements.
*   **Testimonials Section:** A section to showcase positive feedback from users, building trust and social proof.
*   **CTA Section:** A compelling call-to-action section to drive user engagement and sign-ups.
*   **Footer:** A simple, yet elegant footer with essential links and copyright information.
*   **Styling:** A modern, dark theme with a clean and minimalist aesthetic, built with Tailwind CSS.

### Features

*   **Continuous Code Review:** Aura automatically reviews every commit, identifying potential issues and suggesting improvements.
*   **Automated Test Generation:** Aura intelligently generates unit and integration tests, ensuring comprehensive code coverage.
*   **Proactive Issue Detection:** Aura predicts and flags potential regressions and bugs before they make it to production.
*   **Interactive Elements:** The application now includes interactive elements built with React, demonstrating the power of Astro's "Islands Architecture."

## Current Task

I am currently working on updating the landing page to reflect Aura's new identity as an autonomous AI engineering assistant.
